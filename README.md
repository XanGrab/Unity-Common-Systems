## Version 0.1.0

A simple unity package that contains some of my commonly reused systems

- Bootstrapper
- Audio Manager

A utility function used to load any systems required at Runtime (e.g. `AudioManager`). In the Editor hierarchy, a GameObject named "GlobalSystems" gets added on Runtime Initalized.

## Audio Manager üéπ

A utility manager class that utilizes a `Sound` ScriptableObject to play sounds on command from scripts.
