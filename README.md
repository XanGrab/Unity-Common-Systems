# Unity Common Reusable Systems ⚙️

## Version 0.1.2

This simple package contains some assets that are frequently reused across many of my Unity projects.
These assets include:

* `Bootstrapper.cs` - a simple utility script used to load any persistent assets at Runtime
* `SoundSystem` (preview) - namespace containing a simple Audio Manager

## Installation
There are multiple ways this package can be installed, depending on your use case:

1. [Git URL](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/upm-ui-giturl.html) 
  Simplest way to just install the whole package in a project
2. [Asset Package](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/AssetPackages.html)
  Custom install the assets locally that are required for your project
